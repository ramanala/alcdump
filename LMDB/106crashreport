Now trying to commit txn4 which updates one key value pair. We crash in the middle of metadata update (when writing the 106 bytes of data to the metapages.)

We crash in such a way that free list information does not get to disk but the database tree metadata gets to disk.

Environment Info
  Number of pages used: 8
  Last transaction ID: 4

Freelist Status
  Tree depth: 1
  Branch pages: 0
  Leaf pages: 1
  Overflow pages: 0
  Free pages: 1

Status of Main DB
  Tree depth: 1
  Branch pages: 0
  Leaf pages: 1
  Overflow pages: 0

Had it been properly commited, this would be the state:

Environment Info
  Number of pages used: 8

  Branch pages: 0

After this kind of crash, next time when a txn_put is tried, we see this error:

python2.7: lib/mdb.c:1921: mdb_page_touch: Assertion `mp->mp_p.p_pgno != pgno' failed

There is an invariant always expected by mdb => free_pages + current_pages = in_use_pages. The above crash violates this expectation.
